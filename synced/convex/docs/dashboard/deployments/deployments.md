  "Understand Convex deployments including production, development, and preview
  deployments, and how to switch between them in the dashboard."
---

Each project in Convex has a main production deployment, and each developer on
your team can also set up their own personal development deployment.
Additionally, there are
[preview deployments](/production/hosting/preview-deployments.mdx) used to test
backend changes before they're deployed to production.

While on a [deployment page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment), you may
switch between production, your development deployment, and any preview
deployments by using the dropdown menu on the top-left of the page.
