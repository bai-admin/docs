<Admonition type="info">
  The Convex Management API is openly available in Beta. Please contact
  platforms@convex.dev if your use case requires additional capabilities.
</Admonition>

You can programmatically create and manage Convex projects and deployments with
the Management API.

## Authorization

The Management API uses a Bearer token Authorization header.
[Team Access Tokens](/platform-apis#managing-your-own-projects) or
[OAuth Application Tokens](/platform-apis/oauth-applications) can be set as the
Bearer token, depending on if you are using the Management API on behalf of your
own team, or your users' team when building an integration with Convex.

## Required Parameters

Most Management APIs require a team ID, project ID, or both to be accessed. team
and projects IDs are unique numerical values identifying the team or project.

When creating a Team Access Token, the team ID will be available in the Convex
dashboard.

OAuth applications may request the team (or project, if using project-scoped
tokens) ID by calling the [Token Details](/management-api/get-token-details)
endpoint.

When using team-based auth, projects will be assigned IDs (and included in the
API response) upon creation. The [List Projects](/management-api/list-projects)
endpoint may also be used to retrieve the ID for a project.

## Responses

All API responses are in JSON format.
