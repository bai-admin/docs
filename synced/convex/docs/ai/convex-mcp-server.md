The Convex
[Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)
(MCP) server provides several tools that allow AI agents to interact with your
Convex deployment.

## Setup

Add the following command to your MCP servers configuration:

`npx -y convex@latest mcp start`

See editor specific instructions:

- [Cursor](/ai/using-cursor.mdx#setup-the-convex-mcp-server)
- [Windsurf](/ai/using-windsurf.mdx#setup-the-convex-mcp-server)
- [VS Code](/ai/using-github-copilot.mdx#setup-the-convex-mcp-server)

## Available Tools

### Deployment Tools

- **`status`**: Queries available deployments and returns a deployment selector
  that can be used with other tools. This is typically the first tool you'll use
  to find your Convex deployment.

### Table Tools

- **`tables`**: Lists all tables in a deployment along with their:

  - Declared schemas (if present)
  - Inferred schemas (automatically tracked by Convex)
  - Table names and metadata

- **`data`**: Allows pagination through documents in a specified table.

- **`runOneoffQuery`**: Enables writing and executing sandboxed JavaScript
  queries against your deployment's data. These queries are read-only and cannot
  modify the database.

### Function Tools

- **`functionSpec`**: Provides metadata about all deployed functions, including:

  - Function types
  - Visibility settings
  - Interface specifications

- **`run`**: Executes deployed Convex functions with provided arguments.

### Environment Variable Tools

- **`envList`**: Lists all environment variables for a deployment
- **`envGet`**: Retrieves the value of a specific environment variable
- **`envSet`**: Sets a new environment variable or updates an existing one
- **`envRemove`**: Removes an environment variable from the deployment
