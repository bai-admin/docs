---

Convex is a great fit for reactive UI frameworks like Svelte. The
[convex-svelte npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-svelte)
enhances the [ConvexClient](/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient) with declarative
subscriptions in Svelte 5.

See the [Svelte Quickstart](/quickstart/svelte.mdx) to get started. The Svelte
client is open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-svelte).
